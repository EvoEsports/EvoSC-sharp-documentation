# Introduction to the EvoSC# Module Framework
EvoSC# is designed as a modular framework with individual modules responsible for a set of features. The core provides this framework and a library of tools and utilities for developing functionality and logic. The modules provides the actual functionality of the controller and controls the logic.

The framework itself provides a set of coding rules and patterns for developers to implement their desired functionality into the controller.

It is built around *controllers* which holds most of the logic. Controllers respond to actions and events, which are handled and responded to if desired.
