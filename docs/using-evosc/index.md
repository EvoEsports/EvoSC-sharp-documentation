# Introduction
*EvoSC# is currently in development and not a finished product, therefore any use of the software is at your own risk.*

Welcome to the documentation of EvoSC#, the next-generation Trackmania server controller written in .NET Core 7. As the successor of EvoSC, a renowned Trackmania Server Controller written in PHP, EvoSC# brings a whole new level of power, flexibility, and efficiency to the world of Trackmania server management.

With its foundation built on the .NET Core 7 framework, EvoSC# introduces a wide range of enhancements and improvements over its predecessor. It has been designed to streamline the server administration process, provide advanced customization options, and offer an unparalleled user experience for both server administrators and players alike.

## Why should you use EvoSC#?
EvoSC# leverages the power of modern technology to deliver a seamless and responsive server control system. Its clean and intuitive interface allows administrators to effortlessly manage and configure various aspects of their Trackmania servers. From server settings and permissions to plugin management and player moderation, EvoSC# provides a comprehensive suite of tools to ensure smooth operation and optimal performance.

One of the key strengths of EvoSC# lies in its extensibility. Thanks to its modular architecture and plugin system, server administrators can easily customize and enhance their servers with additional features and functionality. Whether you need to integrate custom authentication systems, implement advanced statistics tracking, or create unique game modes, EvoSC#'s plugin system empowers you to tailor your server to your exact specifications.
